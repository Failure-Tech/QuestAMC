{\footnotesize 1. Let $ABCDEFGH$ be a regular octagon, and let $ACEG$ be a square inside of it. If the ratio between the area of $ACEG$ and the area of $ABCDEFGH$ can be represented as $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, find $a+b$.
\\ \\ 
2. How many positive integers $n$ satisfy\[\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor?\](Recall that $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)
\\ \\
3. Determine the number of five-digit positive integer multiples of 11 whose digits sum to 19.
\\ \\
4. Suppose that $13$ cards numbered $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 18$ are arranged in a row. The task is to pick them up in numerically increasing order, working repeatedly from left to right. Let $k$ be the number of the $18!$ possible orderings of the cards such that the cards are picked up in exactly 2 passes. What is the remainder when $k$ is divided by 1000?
\\ \\
5. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers such that\[x^y=2^{k}\text{ and }(\log_2{x})^{\log_2{y}}=2^{16}.\] If there is only 1 possible value for $\log_2{y}$, what is the value of $k$?

6. A frog is initially at the point (0, 0). Every second, the frog jumps from its current
position $(x, y)$ to either $(x + 1, y)$, $(x, y + 1)$, or $(x + 1, y + 1)$, each with equal probability.
The probability that the frog eventually reaches the point (3, 3) is $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.

7. Points $A, B, C, D, E, \text{and} \ F$ lie on the coordinate plane such that $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon and $A, B, C, D$ lie on the parabola $y = 4x^2$. The area of triangle $EFO$, where $O$ is the origin, can be represented by $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $\gcd(a, c) = 1$ and $b$ is squarefree. Find $a+b+c$.
\\ \\
8. A square contains 3 smaller squares to form three trapezoids of area 110, 114, and 92
as shown. If the area of the largest of the four squares can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m + n$. \\
